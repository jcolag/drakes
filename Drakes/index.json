Yet that had a lot to do with the fact that she was a veritable genius.</p>\n<p>Her IQ ranked her as the smartest person alive, clocking in at 268, however she didn\u2019t believe it, said experience meant more than any potential a Intelligence Quiz set her at.</p>\n<p>She had however invented a machine to help her, and that was what had gotten her employers attention.</p>\n<p>She had been involved in a car crash, a eight car pile up after a truck slid off the road because of ice, she was trapped for six hours, yet miraculously she escaped with only a broken arm \u2013 but it wouldn\u2019t heal.</p>\n<p>So she created a exo-skeleton of sorts that wrapped around her arm, and linked it to her brain so she could operate it like a normal human, and it was even capable of giving her back full movement of her fingers, and it was very precise.</p>\n<p>This invention won her worldwide fame; she\u2019d invented it at the age of eight. She was now seventeen, and was working as a bodyguard for Parliament.</p>\n<p>Her name was Suzie Drakes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>She stepped in a closed the limousine door and instantly the senator spoke \u201cGet me out of here\u2026 So sick of those idiots\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The driver pulled away from the curb slowly and Suzie turned and looked out the window, watching for potential threats, running algorithms through her head and creating a library of faces, matching up those that were already in her library with their purposes in the area. She couldn\u2019t see any potential threat yet\u2026 Which probably meant she wasn\u2019t looking hard enough, probably because she couldn\u2019t care less right now.</p>\n<p>The senator was blabbing on to the driver about hard the job was, and how he was the only one who could see any sense so every motion he posed was being opposed.</p>\n<p>Then she saw something, and winced, she threw the door open and spoke, \u201cAccelerate.\u201d</p>\n<p>She spun onto the roof using her robotic right arm, and held on tight, enough that the metal dinted, as the driver did as she said, then she let go and leapt into the air as a truck passed beside her, she snagged the end of the trailer and pulled herself onto it, she walked up slowly towards the cab, just as a shotgun poked out of it, she threw herself to the side, almost rolling off just as the driver fired.</p>\n<p>Suzie stood up slowly and wished to hell that they\u2019d let hr carry a real gun instead of the taser; she could have taken the driver out, even with a .357 from where she was, but not with a taser.</p>\n<p>She clenched her fists and frowned, considering her options, and then smiled as the maths proved useful. She sprinted up towards the cab, just out of reach from the shotgun and as she neared the cab she punched. The fist tore through the metal and hit something hard, she frowned as she pulled her hand back and cocked her head as she saw a slab of granite.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d expected her to take on the truck\u2026 Which meant\u2026</p>\n<p>She spun around and looked into the distance, just in time to see a car explode into the air \u2013 RPG.</p>\n<p>That got to her.</p>\n<p>She got to the driver, and introduced him to the road at 100km/h.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault\u2026 You\u2019re only seventeen for crying out loud! A decoy like that would have taken any agent in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \u201cI know\u2026 But that agent would have been able to help the senator avoid death by rocketed grenade because they would have shot the driver and then stopped the car to confirm the kill. They used the fact that everybody knows I can only use a taser. I can\u2019t protect anyone right now. I\u2019m just a show piece, and pretty terrible at that,\u201d she raised her arm, \u201cBecause this isn\u2019t exactly pretty now is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>John O\u2019Connor, the head of her division, sighed, \u201cNot exactly. What about the incident three weeks ago with the gunman on the roof?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie shrugged, \u201cI was in the right place at the right time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the guy you pasted after he ran through the lobby doors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \u201cAnybody could have punched him out\u2026 And if they had you would have been able to talk to him in half an hour instead of three weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor shook his head sadly, \u201cWhatever\u2026 Go back to school then. For a year. You start your weapons training four days after your eighteenth. It\u2019s an accelerated course for people who have a gift with numbers like you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ve learnt me well.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor grinned, \u201cWell seeing as you fell asleep in you\u2019re a-level physics classes and then aced the exam\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She grinned sheepishly, \u201cIt would have helped if he didn\u2019t have a monotone.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor shrugged, \u201cGo on, get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie turned and tossed the taser onto the table, \u201cCatch you later O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cNo mum. I\u2019m not doing it. That\u2019s final.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on honey, why not? You\u2019re a hero! You could be an inspiration to those kids!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a celebrity. I want to get this over and done with. And what have I said about calling me honey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mum sighed and put a hand on her hip, \u201cSusan Ashley Drakes are you telling me what to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie turned and walked away, and ignored the yelling behind her, why couldn\u2019t she ever fit in? She was too young amongst the guards, and felt too bright amongst people her own age\u2026 She wasn\u2019t going to a school where you didn\u2019t have to study\u2026 It was one of the hardest in the country\u2026 Yet it had never been enough to challenge her after year seven\u2026 Everything had just fallen into place at the end of the year, and all her predictions had come true. Which teachers left, who went out with who, and how long it lasted.</p>\n<p>She had few friends, and thousands of enemies. But that was just another normal day. And her mum wanted her to let the Principal call a special assembly to welcome her back? Hell no.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>She pushed the front doors open and walked into the corridor and all conversation stopped instantly. Suzie laughed and shook her head sadly and walked towards her locker as two boys began walking on a path to intercept her.</p>\n<p>She frowned and tracked the movements, they were on the grid iron team, and from their posture they were restraining themselves, attempting to match her speed, too bad.</p>\n<p>She wasn\u2019t as restrained as she had been\u2026 Her training had taught her how to knock people senseless without leaving a mark on them.</p>\n<p>She reached the locker a couple steps ahead of them, their first mistake.</p>\n<p>She opened her locker and one put his hand on her right shoulder, second mistake.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your hand off me now or you won\u2019t be going to school for a month.\u201d She growled and he laughed, \u201cWhat? You going to arrest me?\u201d Third mistake.</p>\n<p>And his fourth was he didn\u2019t remove his hand. She spun and grabbed it before he could see what was happening, her metal hand grabbed the base of his elbow and squeezed.</p>\n<p>He shouted as his elbow dislocated and she pushed him away and looked at the other, \u201cIf you want a fight you won\u2019t find one here. You\u2019ll find your ass gets kicked. Get lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tried to punch her.</p>\n<p>She grabbed his wrist and used his momentum to fling his head into the platform that held her books up in the locker. It bent on the impact and the guy fell unconscious to the ground.</p>\n<p>Suzie turned back and raised an eyebrow, everybody turned away and began to speak hurriedly, and then came the familiar click of high heels on the floor.</p>\n<p>Perfect timing.</p>\n<p>Suzie pulled the jock out of her locker and dropped him as she got her books, the teacher rounded the corner, \u201cMiss Drakes!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cI was restrained. I\u2019m sure O\u2019Connor explained everything earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>She walked away as the teacher moved her mouth in surprise, unable to find words.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cTherefore x is the equivalent of 3.4168974. Questions?\u201d the student finished and Suzie raised her hand, the maths teacher shivered despite himself and nodded, \u201cGo ahead Susan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuzie.\u201d She shot back and looked at Ted Jameson, \u201cI think that you might want to check part 6 again, because though it might not seem that a decimal point of .00000146 could affect the outcome, it changes it radically.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ted nodded frowning, he turned back and flicked his eyes over the equation and smiled, \u201cThanks Suzie. It\u2019s actually 4.17689 isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c4.176892.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed, \u201cRight again\u2026\u201d Ted adjusted his calculations and sat down, a bemused expression on his face, and a few people starred at him, surprised, she did this every time usually.</p>\n<p>Once the bell went and they went to go to their next classes Ted walked passed Suzie, \u201cCan I get the next three digits?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \u201cNot yet boy. Try harder.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed and walked away towards his class as Suzie went to hers in another direction, she considered him in her mind, bright, yet enough to know when he\u2019s wrong, and yet still bright enough to put a few things together from practically nothing. Now she just needed to know how he behaved.</p>\n<p>She walked through the door to her class, and her instincts took over. She leapt forward as a metal bar slammed down behind her; she spun and kicked the assailant\u2019s feet under from underneath him.</p>\n<p>She leapt to her feet and into the air as another baseball bat swung where her ankles had been, she hit the ground and turned and punched.</p>\n<p>Then she stopped and realised what had just happened, this was her social psychology class. She had been the experiment \u2013 and she had failed it by the looks of things. One student was seriously injured and another was picking himself off the ground.</p>\n<p>Suzie shot a look at her teacher, \u201cThat was just plain stupid. Would you have done that to a returning serviceman? You were told I was trained. You were told I did action. Don\u2019t ever do anything like that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher swallowed, \u201cI thought a bodyguard\u2019s prime directive was defensive, not offensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cOnly while a client is within the threats proximity. If separated they are authorised to use lethal force if necessary to eliminate the threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher nodded, \u201cStephen, can you take Jason to the nurse?\u201d</p>\n<p>The student she\u2019d knocked over nodded and picked up the other slowly and walked out of the room slowly and Suzie turned to the teacher, \u201cI think you should forget this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYet it is still a perfect example of neural networks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed and found a seat, and pulled out her books, she sat back and refused to take notes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Recess.</p>\n<p>Suzie grabbed a drink from her locker and headed out to her old haunt, and saw that as usual it was empty. She flipped easily into the tree and climbed up slowly to the top, and leant back to relax.</p>\n<p>Then she heard somebody below her, she clenched a fist and heard, \u201cEasy girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sat up in surprise as she recognised the voice, she almost fell out of the tree, barely grabbing a branch, he laughed as he climbed up opposite to her, \u201cHello Suzie.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled and pulled herself back up, \u201cYou came here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter this morning I didn\u2019t think I had a whole heap of choice.\u201d John replied and Suzie winced, \u201cSorry about that\u2026 And about psych\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded slowly, \u201cYeah\u2026 I kind of lost it when she told me what she\u2019d tried\u2026 So she kind of knows what your capable of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie groaned, \u201cThanks a lot!\u201d</p>\n<p>John shrugged, \u201cWell\u2026 Davian survived. He\u2019s asking for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? He barely recognised my presence for the last six months.\u201d Suzie frowned, confused, and John nodded, \u201cHe said he felt crippled without a guard around who he could trust\u2026 And that reminded me of something. Did you recognise the driver?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie ran the face through her mind and nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve seen him on three separate occasions near Parliament, and twice in the CBD. In the CBD he was fuelling a truck both times, however near Parliament he has only ridden a bike. A carbon fibre frame, most likely a GS17 series custom built M\u00f5sler.\u201d</p>\n<p>John laughed, \u201cThis is why I need you. Can you draw the face?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded and grabbed the proffered pad and sketched away, she handed it over after a moment and John\u2019s eyebrows rose, \u201cQuite a bit of detail there\u2026 Down to the acne scars\u2026 You saw that in an instant?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded again, \u201cThe human mind is capable of remembering more details than you could possibly believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>John grinned, \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll run him against our database and see if we get any hits\u2026 What was his purpose near the Parliament?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \u201cThe reason I tracked was that he had a son living in the area. Samuel R. Anderson\u2026 I believe that he was once a bodyguard for Senator Gregorio. I thought he was clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>John shrugged, \u201cEverybody gets it wrong\u2026 And it could have been a once off thing, forced into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cIf it had been he wouldn\u2019t have shot at me unless there was somebody else in that truck. I doubt that there was.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded and then Suzie\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYour kidding me! I missed it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced, \u201cYeah\u2026 He got away.\u201d</p>\n<p>She bit her bottom lip and then spoke, \u201cI broke his jaw. How could somebody in that state take out your guards?\u201d</p>\n<p>John shook his head, \u201cAverage cops were taking him in. Both were shot with high density rounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinish school.\u201d John said looking at her sternly, his face relaxed and he continued, \u201cAnd keep in the loop. I\u2019ll give you regular fortnightly check ups. I think I\u2019ll put Jack on the missing truckie, what do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie shrugged, \u201cHe\u2019s certainly capable of it\u2026 If he remembers his manners.\u201d</p>\n<p>John laughed, \u201cRight. I\u2019ll remind him. See you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dropped out of the tree and began walking away, and Suzie rolled her eyes as she saw girls going weak at the knees as he passed.</p>\n<p>Then the bell went and Suzie dropped to the ground and began walking towards her locker, as girls sprinted up to her, \u201cWhat\u2019s his number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you two going out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie ignored them then opened her locker and grabbed her books, and turned and walked towards physics. She wondered whether Ted would work out the other three digits if she gave him a chance\u2026 She grinned at the thought.</p>\n<p>She opened the door and the teacher winced, \u201cYou really are back. Please don\u2019t drool on the desk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie grinned, \u201cI won\u2019t\u2026 I think I might actually help out a bit this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tried to smile, but it came out more as a grimace.</p>\n<p>She took a seat and pulled out her books as the other students began arriving, and Ted immediately sat next to her, \u201cAny chance at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \u201cNone with that attitude. Show a little more confidence, and a little more curiosity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ted laughed, \u201cSo I have to guess it do I?\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher coughed and Ted turned back to the front and he begun, \u201cToday we are starting the chapter on trajectory. Please don\u2019t snore Susan.\u201d</p>\n<p>She gritted her teeth, \u201cSuzie. And I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d</p>\n<p>The class laughed and he began, she tried to pay attention, but very quickly she blanked out.</p>\n<p>Then an opportunity arose and Suzie held up her hand as the fog lifted slowly after nobody could answer the question, and the teacher turned to her, \u201cGo ahead Su...zie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe angle has an infinitesimal continuous decimal, so I won\u2019t bore you all with exactness. But it is approximately 19.814 degrees and the force required is 27 newtons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ted\u2019s head jerked up and he wrote a number down on his hand and Suzie sat down laughing, \u201cThat\u2019s not it boy. Think a little more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ted frowned and looked at the figure, 0417 689 2 (814)-24.</p>\n<p>Then he smiled and wrote \u20180417 689 291.\u2019 Suzie nodded to herself and grinned, maybe he was worth it.</p>\n<p>Then her phone vibrated. She waited and counted, three times\u2026 It was a call.</p>\n<p>She had to take it. She looked at her teacher who was frowning, \u201cThat\u2019s not quite right Suzie.\u201d</p>\n<p>She gritted her teeth, she needed an out\u2026 Somehow\u2026</p>\n<p>Then she saw a figure waving out the window and looked over, the teacher coughed, \u201cExcuse me. I\u2019m talking to you Susan.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled to herself, she had an out. \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p>\n<p>His response was fast and predictable, \u201cGet out. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stood up and walked out, not quite managing to hide her pleasure with the decision, as soon as the door closed she grabbed her phone and answered it, \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Susan.\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowned, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you cooperate you will live. If you don\u2019t. You will die. And O\u2019Connor will die.\u201d</p>\n<p>She swallowed, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou. Or rather we want you to build something for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Drakes! Get off that phone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she interferes with this conversation she will die. Get rid of her. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie began sweating and turned to the teacher and spoke quietly, \u201cCode Z-T.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher frowned and then turned around and walked away, \u201cThat was very clever. An exit strategy already in place. Now\u2026 Walk down the hall and follow your Route 612 to the back gate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell did you know about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust do it girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie ran the path, a pre-set escape route, one she\u2019d never mentioned to any body, simply memorised. She saw O\u2019Connor starring at her through the window for a brief flash and the voice on the phone spoke again, \u201cWarn him if you want, but don\u2019t slow down. Or he dies. Then you will die five minutes later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie gritted her teeth as she rounded a corner, as she saw the window approaching she flashed a finger symbol and O\u2019Connor instantly swore and began sprinting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you warn him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie swallowed, \u201cImminent threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich party? You or he?\u201d</p>\n<p>She winced and skidded around a corner, \u201cBoth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClever girl. However seeing as we can track even small movements like that\u2026 I think it\u2019s fair to say we can still kill him whenever we want to. Remember that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rounded the final corner and put up her shoulder as she ran through the doors, they exploded open and she slipped as her foot missed the stairs, she tucked and rolled, but dropped the phone.</p>\n<p>It shattered on the stairs and she swore, now she couldn\u2019t get more information on the target.</p>\n<p>She leapt to her feet and grabbed the pieces and stuffed them in her pocket and sprinted towards the back gate, as she neared it a van drove up and the sliding door opened, she leapt inside, and it took off again and the door slammed shut.</p>\n<p>The man who had closed it turned to her, he looked about eighteen at the most.</p>\n<p>He grinned, \u201cWell, well. Susan Drakes herself.\u201d</p>\n<p>She glared at him and he grinned, \u201cBut you prefer Suzie don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sneered, \u201cNot from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowned, \u201cAnd who am I? I\u2019m just the delivery boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who was on the phone\u2026 I would like to know where the cameras where placed though.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie raised an eyebrow, \u201cTry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep some secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \u201cHow about an alias? At the very least I would like to match a name to the face I\u2019m going to break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJosiah McIntyre.\u201d</p>\n<p>She struggled to keep the emotion from her face, Josiah was more famous than she was, he was the inventor of several weapons that had changed the course of history. He\u2019d invented and deployed satellite weapons that had used lasers, an attempt to remove nuclear technology, but far scarier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were twenty two\u2026\u201d She frowned and Josiah nodded, \u201cI am. I know I look younger\u2026 But I always have.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grinned at her, \u201cI think you should be able to put one and one together now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The blood drained from Suzie\u2019s face, \u201cArmoured poseable exo-skeleton. Attach to it your laser weapons and have a triangulation method to make it precise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded, \u201cYep. But now that I\u2019ve had time to examine that arm I\u2019m fairly certain I won\u2019t need you\u2026 But I know no matter what I do you\u2019ll be trying to get the word out, so why should I make things easy for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \u201cYou predicted me didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah laughed, \u201cYes\u2026 But in what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sneered, \u201cYou engineered the attack on the Senator, a viable target, simply to make sure I could be removed from duty, and you knew it would be of my own free will\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Josiah asked knowingly and Suzie winced, \u201cSo I was easy to pick up, and it was easy to get an eyeball on O\u2019Connor\u2026 A section chief\u2019s assassination isn\u2019t something I\u2019d let be on my own head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shook his head, \u201cMore than that. I know that O\u2019Connor is like a big brother to you, and he\u2019s your friend. I counted more on the emotional level than the professional, which is fairly stupid in retrospect, the only time that really works well is when two people are in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \u201cA genius who is in love with money is my current assessment of you. I think it will change\u2026 For the worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t really care. McIntyre Industries is the most profitable company in the world. The shares were selling at ten thousand dollars a piece two hours ago. You\u2019re going to help me change that. For the better\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie kept quiet; she knew something didn\u2019t quite ring true about that statement\u2026</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cWhat is this about O\u2019Connor? I haven\u2019t heard anything on the horn about another Senator being beaten up\u2026 So what do you want with me?\u201d Chief Detective Superintendent Styles asked, and the man standing in his office turned and looked out the window, \u201cOne of my agents has been captured.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles raised his eyebrows, \u201cThe kidnapping of a bodyguard? That\u2019s very unusual\u2026 Unless it is of course the girl who is off duty\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor simply nodded and Styles shrugged, \u201cWhat can we do? How can we do anything about it? Because I assume you have no leads, because your not supposed to be in contact with her, so as the school hasn\u2019t reported it in\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor turned, \u201cShe was an exception. She was given a priority two status. Not by me\u2026 By somebody higher. She was being kept in the loop\u2026 And I was about to try and bring her back in, when she got a phone call from somebody. Then she took off like crazy\u2026 She warned me of imminent danger to both our lives, likely by sniper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles grinned, \u201cAll those hand signals\u2026 It still amazes me that people can remember them.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor nodded, \u201cYeah\u2026 But now she\u2019s in immediate danger, and she broke her phone a moment before she was taken\u2026Well\u2026 She jumped into the van. I\u2019m assuming somebody close to her was threatened, such as her family, and enough proof was supplied.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shook his head, \u201cNo. They threatened you and her by the sounds of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor frowned, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make much sense\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she a good employee?\u201d Styles asked with a hint of contempt in his voice.</p>\n<p>John frowned, \u201cShe\u2019s dedicated\u2026 Oh. She wouldn\u2019t let a section chief die. Damn it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cWhat sort of details on the van have you got?\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced, but stayed silent, and Styles frowned, \u201cJohn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe van belongs to McIntyre Industries. It was registered as missing three months ago after an office party.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles sighed, \u201cSo pretty much we\u2019ve got nothing. Because McIntyre won\u2019t let us waltz in\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor sighed and Styles frowned, \u201cHow close are you to her?\u201d</p>\n<p>John starred at him and spoke slowly, \u201cShe\u2019s one of my guard. You know what I would risk for each and every one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour career. Your honour. Your life. In that order.\u201d Styles replied.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah looked over at Suzie as the van pulled up, \u201cHow many kilometres did the van travel once we\u2019d picked you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled, \u201cTwenty seven point four. And as the crow flies we\u2019re sixteen point eight kilometres from the school. Which places us in the warehouse that was recently bought for twice its value.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah raised an eyebrow and Suzie grinned, \u201cI like to know all possible dangers to my clients.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded slowly, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a gift\u2026 But you\u2019re still wrong. I did buy the warehouse\u2026 But this isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slid open to reveal a housing estate. She blinked.</p>\n<p>Josiah grinned, \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes at that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cStyles\u2026 Why do I always shiver when you come in person instead of call?\u201d Jason McKenzie asked, and his boss grinned, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job in your line of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason shook his head, \u201cHeck no. Barely got out alive last time!\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shrugged, \u201cThat was because of some creep with a gas tank, this is a lot easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason glared, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles sighed, \u201cI would have thought anyone would jump at the chance to get McIntyre.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason cringed, \u201cI\u2019m really not doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles raised an eyebrow and Jason glared, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded.</p>\n<p>Jason swore.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cO\u2019Connor! I knew I should never have let my daughter join your pretend cops!\u201d</p>\n<p>John cringed and put the receiver down and listened quietly to the rant and rave, then picked it up and spoke quietly, \u201cI am not aware of anything surrounding your daughter. Now from what you\u2019ve said, she\u2019s disappeared? She may well have simply gone somewhere to cool off. I am aware she got into a couple of fights at school. Because the school called me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 Why would she go off on her own? Without telling anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced as he continued the lie, \u201cYour daughter is very independent, so should she want somebody to know where she was? When she wanted to hide?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I disturbed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>John hung up politely and massaged his forehead, trying to think\u2026 Then he frowned, and picked up the phone and dialled into one of the research departments, \u201cThat warehouse Suzie picked up on\u2026 How far is it from the Parliament again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne moment\u2026 Sixteen kilometres by car. Fourteen point eight by air.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThankyou.\u201d He hung up and logged into the system and pulled up a map and located the warehouse. Sixteen kilometres to Parliament\u2026 Twenty-seven point four to her school. A very small distance to cover to create a very large message.</p>\n<p>He rang the courts. He needed a warrant.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah pointed to the elevator and Suzie looked at him, he laughed, \u201cYou think I want my head taken off? You go alone on the way up. If you don\u2019t arrive\u2026 You know the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded slowly and stepped in, as the elevator began to ascend, she completely ignored Josiah\u2019s advice. She checked the roof hatch for a wire, and then exited slowly, and then she dropped off the edge of the elevator and began to let herself descend, then reached out with her metallic arm and grabbed an opening before it could shoot passed. She jerked to a stop and blinked as stars faded from her view and pulled herself upright, and punched between the doors and pried them open.</p>\n<p>What she saw was astonishing.</p>\n<p>Beyond the elevator shaft was an empty building.</p>\n<p>There were only two floors in a building that was supposed to have forty. The bottom and the top\u2026 And the top level was only half there.</p>\n<p>This was a building site\u2026 For her creation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jason frowned; to track the van down had been easy enough. Since it had been on record he\u2019d simply sent the satellite feeds from the past six hours through a filter and come up with a match.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019d watched the kidnapping sequence, and was very impressed. It had been done fast, with efficiency and as little wasted time as possible. However it had required Suzie\u2019s co-operation, and they had got her to give that easily.</p>\n<p>He spanned out on the IR to view the entire school grounds and watched it again, he needed to know what edge they had on her. Nothing out of the ordinary except the girl and O\u2019Connor freaking after a signal\u2026</p>\n<p>He spanned out further and his eyes almost popped out of his head. Clear as day a sniper was sitting half a kilometre from the site, with an angle on O\u2019Connor the whole time.</p>\n<p>That was the threat\u2026 And Suzie was loyal.</p>\n<p>Now what were the likely candidates who could have pulled off a job like this\u2026 With a McIntyre van\u2026</p>\n<p>Jason smiled and began hacking the system.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Styles frowned as the file was handed to him, \u201cWhere was the body found?\u201d</p>\n<p>His lieutenant frowned, \u201cI told you sir, at the warehouse on that map.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded, \u201cThe problem is that is so close to Parliament\u2026 And according to this he died early yesterday\u2026 And has only just been discovered. Thirty six hours in a high priority zone doesn\u2019t make us look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll take it. You can go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThankyou sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles picked up the phone and dialled. O\u2019Connor needed to know.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jason smiled, as he saw the figures searching the empty husk of a building, while watching Suzie avoiding detection easily enough.</p>\n<p>Then one of the men looked up, and Jason grinned and pulled up the snapshot in time of that motion, and pulled up the face, and increased the resolution, and the heat pads showed up.</p>\n<p>His grin broadened, \u201cIf you\u2019re a McIntyre employee these will be on file\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s grin vanished as a hit came up.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah rolled his eyes, and shouted, \u201cCome on little monkey! Where can you go from all the way up there and survive? You can\u2019t get out that way!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the girl did a flip, and Josiah felt his heart do the same as Suzie landed on the platform, and he saw the metal bar she was carrying, that she\u2019d torn off the bracing of the upper floor.</p>\n<p>The first guard fell immediately, the next dodged the first blow, and not the second.</p>\n<p>Josiah turned to one of his guards, \u201cTranq her already!\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard nodded and spoke into the radio, as the next guard fell.</p>\n<p>A guard rolled out from the elevator and fired at Suzie, and Josiah frowned as he saw her dodge, and then toss the pipe.</p>\n<p>He winced as he saw the guard fall over, and turned to the guard, \u201cShut down the elevator. Make her come to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard ran over and hit a switch, just as Suzie reached the elevator doors.</p>\n<p>She barely paused, and went through into the shaft, Josiah gritted his teeth and grabbed a tranquilliser rifle and pointed it towards the shaft, waiting for the girl to appear.</p>\n<p>Instead he heard a shearing sound and jerked his head up to see Suzie jumping out of a hole in the shaft; Josiah pulled the rifle up and fired, aiming for her left shoulder.</p>\n<p>Perfect shot.</p>\n<p>She went limp in the air; he dropped his gun and dove to catch her.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cStyles. Have you got anything that I can use? I need evidence before I\u2019m allowed to do anything\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing hard\u2026 But the warehouse doesn\u2019t concern you. However a certain housing block does. An apartment building that is really just an empty shell contains your girl. And you\u2019d never guess whom we got an identity on\u2026 One of her captors\u2026 Is bloody Josiah McIntyre.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap. Didn\u2019t want to hear that. How am I meant to get her out now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I\u2019d know! The address is Twelve Andrews lane, out at Braxton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe new estate\u2026 He must have planned everything to a t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be interviewing him later\u2026 A stiff turned up in the warehouse. Keep in touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles rang off and John felt like he needed to hit something badly. He headed down towards the training gym.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cRemind me to never piss you off.\u201d</p>\n<p>John stopped and turned from the punching bag, sweat running down his back, \u201cHey Jack. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe missing truckie turned up. As a corpse.\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced, \u201cWhat kind of people are we dealing with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNasty. The truckie\u2019s broken jaw was torn out of his face and inserted into his eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeesh\u2026\u201d John frowned, \u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack scratched his head, \u201cThat overpaid for warehouse\u2026 Local cops called it in. I think a friend of yours is handling the case. Chief Detective Superintendent Styles.\u201d</p>\n<p>John frowned, \u201cYou sure it was him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded, \u201cHe was carrying his license on him, and matched the drawing you gave me. It was definitely Jacob Anderson.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cGive me five minutes and we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles turned around and frowned as he saw two people waiting at the yellow tape that cordoned the area off, \u201cThey\u2019re from the bodyguard branch of ASIO. The deceased has something to do with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cIs that John O\u2019Connor?\u201d</p>\n<p>The policeman nodded and swallowed, and Styles rolled his eyes, \u201cLet them through\u2026 O\u2019Connor out ranks me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cop turned and walked towards them and Styles clenched his jaw, what was the man playing at coming here?</p>\n<p>As John walked up beside him Styles spoke, \u201cI think I should let you know that the only reason your ass is being kicked out of here is your rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded, \u201cTrue enough\u2026 But Anderson was the one who fired the shotgun at one of my agents. He drove the truck that was the red herring that almost got Senator Davian killed. So I am fully within my rights to be here. He\u2019s my suspect; I need to know why he died. I know how, and it ain\u2019t a nice thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cRight\u2026 Well\u2026 I can\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p>\n<p>John frowned, \u201cYou\u2019ve removed the body\u2026 Show me what was here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shrugged, \u201cPretty much nothing. Until this morning nobody had been here since the clean out and the purchase. The movers were bringing equipment in this morning, they found the corpse.\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced, \u201cJaw through the eyes\u2026 Do you think it was making sure he would never talk or his failure to take out the guard completely?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shrugged, \u201cTo early to make conjecture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt your best guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shrugged, \u201cFrom what little we have, I\u2019d say it was to shut him up. Because it looked like he was involved voluntarily didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>John sighed, \u201cWe need to speak to the son. You got the address?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cWhat son?\u201d</p>\n<p>John frowned, \u201cSamuel R. Anderson. Lives in the Parliament area, was once a bodyguard to Senator Gregorio.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles raised his eyebrows, \u201cThat changes things. I\u2019ll find him, and then I\u2019ll call you. But for now, get the hell out of my jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cThankyou.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned and walked away and Styles wondered who was the agent that was shadowing John\u2026 Then it hit him; John had only gotten involved when it turned out there was a murder. This kid had been tracking down the stiff.</p>\n<p>And it was his own police who had let this poor sod escape custody, to go get killed\u2026 Or let him be kidnapped. To be executed.</p>\n<p>Crap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie opened her eyes slowly, and frowned as she saw Josiah sitting with his back to her slowly drawing up some plans for something.</p>\n<p>She sat up quickly, and winced as the blood rushed to her head and she stifled a groan. Josiah spoke softly, \u201cYou should have one hell of a headache. Take your time in your recovery\u2026 Nobody will find you here. Your boss is searching\u2026 But I have sufficient protocols in place to distract him. Take your time\u2026 Once the machine is built you are free to go. I can\u2019t afford to have murder on my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>She dropped backwards onto the pillow and frowned, where had the bed come from? And why was Josiah sitting on the end?</p>\n<p>The plans!</p>\n<p>\u201cStop thinking girl. It will only hurt more.\u201d</p>\n<p>She winced and spoke, \u201cYour drawing up plans for your idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly from what I can theorise. Now go back to sleep. I need you at your best.\u201d</p>\n<p>If he hadn\u2019t kidnapped her she might have liked working with him\u2026</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cWhat is it Jack?\u201d John asked as he drove, and the agent spoke slowly, \u201cHe acted very coldly. You let him get away with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor smiled, \u201cHe had started putting it together when we left. He\u2019ll have just remembered that I wouldn\u2019t have to be researching a corpse if his men had done their job properly. That\u2019s your next job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack winced, \u201cInterview the cops that were meant to take him in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir in the hospital. Show your badge. That\u2019s more than enough to get you an interview. Officers O\u2019Reilly and Courtney.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded, \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cSorry. No visitors now. Visiting hours are over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack rolled his eyes, \u201cI know that. I carry a little authority though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could outrank Detective Styles and I wouldn\u2019t let you in.\u201d The nurse retorted and Jack grinned, \u201cDo you really mean that? Because I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled out his badge and put it on the counter. Her eyes widened in shock as she saw the four little letters that made police jump when he said, ASIO.</p>\n<p>She nodded, \u201cRoom 243 and 246.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack smiled and picked it up, \u201cThankyou so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned and began walking down the hallway as he heard her calling in to confirm his validity. She\u2019d get it.</p>\n<p>Jack Olsen was a registered member of ASIO\u2026 But he was still in the car with O\u2019Connor. So he didn\u2019t have much time\u2026 Jack Bush was an assassin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jack stepped out of the car, \u201cSee you soon sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor nodded, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the car pulled away Jack walked into reception, the nurse was on the phone and Jack pulled out his badge and put it on the bench, and he saw confusion cross her face, and he saw the pad in front of her, Jack Olsen, ASIO, CO - J. O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p>His jaw dropped, \u201cThey\u2019re already here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack sneered and pulled a pistol, \u201cCall security. Which rooms?\u201d</p>\n<p>The nurse hung up the phone and swallowed, \u201c243 and 246.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned and sprinted away as he heard her dialling.</p>\n<p>He rounded a corner and saw the first room, yanked the door open, and winced. The assassin had already been here. Blood sprayed the entire back wall, and there was little left of the face.</p>\n<p>He backed out and spun, looking at 246\u2026 It opened slowly and a man walked calmly out of it.</p>\n<p>Jack fired twice.</p>\n<p>The left kneecap shattered and the man went down, the man pointed his gun up to Jack, but he fired, and the hand became a stump.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot today asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man laughed through gritted teeth, \u201cYour too late though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack walked up and knocked him out before he could try another way out.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>John stepped out of the car and looked over as he saw a group of police standing around a single figure. Their CO\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cFast off the blocks.\u201d He said as he walked towards the man, who sighed, \u201cWhy the hell am I always in your jurisdiction?\u201d</p>\n<p>John shrugged, \u201cDon\u2019t chase my bait. Simple answer to that\u2026 The other answer is that your men stuff up around me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t test me O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 Did they manage to talk to you? To prove otherwise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles sighed, \u201cYour attitude is so\u2026 vexing all of the time. Why don\u2019t you learn to be a little different?\u201d</p>\n<p>John laughed, \u201cJust give me the answer. Then I\u2019ll consider your advice\u2026 Then ignore it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded, \u201cI only talked to one\u2026 The other was still out. In fact he hadn\u2019t come around when he was killed. The one I talked to\u2026 Didn\u2019t remember a thing. Didn\u2019t even remember when he took custody of your missing truckie.\u201d</p>\n<p>John winced, \u201cSo we\u2019ve got nothing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles shook his head, \u201cYour agent took custody of the assassin. Didn\u2019t you realise? Isn\u2019t that why you came?\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cYeah\u2026 But the assassin faked being my agent. So\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles nodded, \u201cThey\u2019re both in the middle car.\u201d</p>\n<p>John turned and walked towards the car. Jack had some explaining to do.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie opened her eyes slowly and sat up, rubbing the back of her head. Then she took a look around, and she saw only one person in sight, and she was shocked as she saw what he was doing.</p>\n<p>Josiah stood with his back to her some distance away, with two robotic exoskeleton arms. They weren\u2019t like the one she had\u2026 Far more advanced.</p>\n<p>He was using them to build something else, and attached to the wrist was a tool of some sort, and as she watched it folded into the arm and something else came out, and this she recognised, a plasma cutter.</p>\n<p>Tools on both wrists were constantly folding in and out, and Josiah was sweating over whatever he was constructing, however it was a tiny object.</p>\n<p>She stood up slowly, and stretched, and winced as she felt her arm refuse to move, she reached over to her shoulder and pressed a catch and a hissing filled the air.</p>\n<p>Then she pulled a latch and winced as the metal frame eased away from her body, and she slowly pulled the metal frame off and laid it on the ground in front of her.</p>\n<p>Suzie knelt down and looked at it closely, and bit her lip as she saw the cause of the lack of movement. One of the microprocessors was missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m almost done with it\u2026 I couldn\u2019t duplicate the coding\u2026 I couldn\u2019t get a grip on the syntax that you used\u2026 It wasn\u2019t any recognisable programming language\u2026 And it relied on other libraries built on non-existent libraries\u2026 I went down to the hex code, and damn it was complex. So I kind of\u2026 Borrowed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie raised an eyebrow at Josiah, \u201cAre you apologising? To somebody you kidnapped?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah swallowed, \u201cYeah\u2026 Guess I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \u201cRight\u2026 So what have you been building that you needed those arms for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy own microprocessor. One to replace yours\u2026 But it needs to be able to handle four limbs with as much precision.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded, \u201cRight. Hurry up. I hate not being able to use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah turned back around and continued working, and finished two minutes later and touched one of the arm plates and pressed a sequence of buttons and the processor rose to the surface and he pulled it out gently, and then replaced it with his own.</p>\n<p>The chip slid in and Josiah moved his arms and winced at something, the movements seemed a little more emphatic than normal, but other than that Suzie didn\u2019t notice anything.</p>\n<p>Josiah unbuckled the arms and stepped out of them, and picked up her processor and walked over to her, and placed it in it\u2019s place, a piece of metal immediately slid over it.</p>\n<p>He smiled softly at her and helped her place the machine on again, as it powered up Suzie moved it slowly, and winced as the familiar movement returned, it only occurred at the start of the day, as her muscles unstiffened from sleep.</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cHow do you do it? Let people look at you day by day as some sort of cryptic genius? I\u2019m no where near your level\u2026 And yet I have to put on an act of arrogance\u2026 Though I lose myself in the act most days\u2026 I forget who I am\u2026 How do you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled softly, \u201cMy attitude has always been one of defiance\u2026 Even before this happened to me\u2026 Before I let people see how brilliant I really am\u2026 So I don\u2019t care what they think of me. I do what I do, I become the best I am, and if they don\u2019t like it\u2026 They can go jump for all I care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah laughed, \u201cRight\u2026 Well\u2026 I have what I need\u2026 You can build whatever you want in here\u2026 I just ask you don\u2019t kill or harm my men\u2026 And don\u2019t try and leave before I\u2019m finished. Please also don\u2019t sabotage anything\u2026 Try and be a nice guest\u2026 Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I do want to run\u2026 It\u2019s been a while since I can talk to anyone who can understand anything I do\u2026 Even when I drop hints\u2026 They fail so often\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cThat thing with Ted meant a lot to you didn\u2019t it? And he failed your test didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie winced, \u201cYeah. I\u2019d given up hope finding anyone my age on my level\u2026 He was a chance. He still has potential\u2026 But I don\u2019t have the patience to train him and then to fall for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah laughed, \u201cI know what you mean\u2026 You know how much I\u2019m in the spotlight\u2026 I don\u2019t like older women.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie grinned, \u201cMost of them would be old enough to be your mother wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah rolled his eyes, \u201cYeah\u2026 Please don\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cJack Bush.\u201d Styles frowned as he looked down at the file in front of him, behind the metal desk sat the assassin, arms crossed and looking half asleep\u2026 Didn\u2019t really care that he\u2019d been caught. He was somewhat\u2026 cocky.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>The assassin nodded and stifled a yawn, and Styles smiled, \u201cWho did you pretend to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJack Olsen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles grinned, \u201cWas that easy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cSo it was difficult?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles blinked, and realised that despite the look the assassin was well and truly awake, and knew everything that he was allowed to say\u2026 Because he knew what evidence they had. Bush wasn\u2019t about to let them have any more.</p>\n<p>Damn it.</p>\n<p>Behind the one-way mirror sat a man running a hand through his hair, thinking hard.</p>\n<p>John O\u2019Connor was worried, and for a very good reason, Jack Olsen was not a well-known figure, in fact he\u2019d only transferred to John\u2019s department a couple months ago. He was an office boy, a researcher of high degree.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been rented out to the police a couple times, but not on any publicised assignment. Which meant that he\u2019d come to the attention of whoever he was up against a while ago. At least eighteen months\u2026</p>\n<p>John O\u2019Connor was a worried man.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie frowned as she picked up the chip and examined it, \u201cWire well enough\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah turned around, \u201cI just got that working!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded, \u201cI know\u2026 I also know that it isn\u2019t as good as mine so shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shook his head, and then a beep emitted from one of his pockets and Josiah gritted his teeth and Suzie laughed, \u201cBoard members?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shook his head, \u201cWhy do I have to have a secretary? I think I\u2019m late for a meeting\u2026 Which means that they\u2019re going to be yelling again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, a twinkle returning to her eye, she was enjoying herself now, even if he was with a kidnapper.</p>\n<p>As Josiah took out his phone and answered, she stifled her laughter and turned her mind to the processor. She inserted it in the PC that had been set up for the task and rolled her eyes as the code appeared.</p>\n<p>\u201cA modified VR system? No wonder it\u2019s laggy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah covered the mouthpiece and spoke, \u201cIt\u2019s not that noticeable!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cYes it is. Aren\u2019t you meant to be doing something?\u201d</p>\n<p>She tapped a few keys and a file backed up his code, and then she cleared it and began typing. She sent out an ftp request to a set of hex libraries she had set up and they loaded into the chip, and then she began writing in a coding language that felt natural to her, yet nobody else had yet set their eyes on it.</p>\n<p>Josiah hung up the phone and sighed, he turned to her and frowned, \u201cHoly\u2026 Is that a node based system? It recognises nodes in a biological system? Sheesh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t recognise nodes in a biological system. This coding language is a section of another language I created. That original language was created for use in a quantum neuron network, a highly complex system capable of logical reasoning. This is a cut down version\u2026 So it\u2019s only got the logic, a difference engine of sorts\u2026 Which allows it to be manipulated by the human body easily.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled, \u201cThere is a computer chip, a tiny processor, less than three millimetres across, lodged inside my brain. Attached to the motion sensoria. It and the chip in my arm that this is a replacement for send commands back and forth, built almost exactly as a replica for the nervous system. In fact\u2026 If my diagnostic\u2019s were correct earlier this year, it could be used as a way to overcome MS, multiple scrolosis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded slowly, \u201cRight\u2026 I wish I could cancel this meeting\u2026 But it\u2019s an international, so I\u2019m pushing my luck as is. I\u2019ll be back later\u2026 And could you teach me a little more about this system?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded, \u201cOf course\u2026 Though by the time you come back I might have built a QNN.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuantum neuron network\u2026 Attach it to a high-power computer\u2026 That would be something. See you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned around and stepped into the elevator and waved her goodbye and Suzie frowned to herself, was this the Stockholm Syndrome she was feeling?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cJack.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked up as the man sat down in front of him, \u201cCrap. So he isn\u2019t talking to me right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man shook his head, \u201cO\u2019Connor couldn\u2019t find a reason for Styles to take you in. That\u2019s the only reason your talking to me and not to steel bars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 How do you think he got your details? He had your security question for goodness sakes. That\u2019s enormous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded slowly, \u201cThe assassin\u2019s name was Jack Bush wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man shrugged, \u201cWhat does a name have to do with this unless it\u2019s your name and the people who know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack winced, \u201cEnough with the burn. Jack Bush was once a suspect in international fraud. I was the one who found him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Why isn\u2019t it in your file?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is. It\u2019s in my classified record. Not even O\u2019Connor has authority to barge in and request that information though. I was moved from research because somebody had tried to assassinate me. I was too prominent a figure. If you want this information, and only O\u2019Connor can request with this code, not you, then you need to request from ASIO a 2AC report with authentication code 418C9B6A314D.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man blinked and Jack smiled, \u201cWant me to write that down for you?\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie grinned as she finished programming the chip and replaced it in the machine, and then she set about building the other section that would be required, a chip that would attach to the skin on the outside, and once the power off command had been given it would detach and could easily be removed. It connected his mind to the machine he was building, so that he could easily manipulate it, and not have to get used to the sensation of being able to control more than four limbs like she had when she had had the procedure.</p>\n<p>She finished it and attached the cables to the set of arms, she stepped back and smiled at her work turned around and frowned as she saw the crates of parts, and then an idea occurred to her and she began scrounging through it\u2026 Particular parts in her mind.</p>\n<p>She came up with three parts out of the required fifteen and frowned, and walked over to the elevator and hit the intercom, a gruff voice came back, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cParts. Can you pick up the order if I get it delivered to the front door?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you do that? You don\u2019t know where this is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie rolled her eyes, \u201cOf course I do. I have both Internet access and eyes. I can see out the windows up here. I recognise the area. So shut up and answer the question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sneered and turned her back on the intercom and walked over to the parts again and began pulling out other particular parts, several blue-ray drives, a couple motherboards and several 500watt power supplies, and a blank processor chip.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah entered the building and frowned at the guard who seemed to be panicking and hit the emergency button repeatedly. Which just caused Josiah\u2019s phone to receive a call.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard spun around, \u201cSam\u2019s on his way to hospital\u2026 Burn wounds\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Josiah repeated louder and the guard swallowed, \u201cI pissed her off\u2026 Refused to pick up parts from outside here if she ordered them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah cringed, \u201cIdiot! Even if you had to cross town you should have picked them up! She\u2019s more than capable of murdering us all where we stand with what\u2019s in that room. I told you to help her out wherever you could! Stand aside. I\u2019ll go talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah hit the elevator switch and shook his head sadly at the guard as it began to ascend, as the doors opened he heard a buzz and leapt out of his skin as the wall went black next to him.</p>\n<p>He looked over at Suzie as she held what looked like a junky pistol at him, \u201cEasy!\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded, \u201cIt would be.\u201d</p>\n<p>He winced, \u201cThe guard ignored my advice\u2026 I just got back\u2026 Now tell me why exactly your trying to kill me with a high powered laser gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie grinned, \u201cBecause I want to go now. If I\u2019m going to be left with jerks\u2026 I think I\u2019ll simply break out. How does that sound?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah winced, \u201cBad. Very bad\u2026 Because it means people will get hurt or die. Before I can do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned and Josiah sighed, \u201cI\u2019m building the exoskeleton for a military contract. However I\u2019ll be building a little safe guard into it. Something that might make a statement and a half.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled, \u201cElectro-magnetic pulse\u2026 How large?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shrugged, \u201cWith my current designs it could take down one hundred thousand square kilometres\u2026 But that\u2019s not enough for me. I need to be able to take down at least four hundred and thirty eight square kilometres.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie raised her eyebrows, \u201cThat\u2019s the entire of Iraq\u2026 Sure that\u2019s a wise decision?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shrugged, \u201cI need to make a statement. Every weapon I\u2019ve produced in the last six years has a similar EMP device inbuilt\u2026 The newer it is the larger it can go. It will be a world wide phenomenon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could break the world with that\u2026 People don\u2019t know how to deal with something of that size.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s worth the risk isn\u2019t it? To make a civilised people\u2026 We may need to sacrifice civilisation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t say I agree with it. But I agree with the principle behind it. We need to stop the wars\u2026 I don\u2019t agree that this is the way. You might save a few people\u2026 But you can just as easily cause a world war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith what? McIntyre Industries is the world\u2019s number one supplier of weapons. To both terrorists and governments thanks to the black market. This EMP can be triggered multiple times. I could do it again\u2026 I could make it permanent. New technology would have to be developed. People would be forced to change either way\u2026 Even if it\u2019s only their perspective. It is the capacity for good in the human race that makes this worth while\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sighed, \u201cRight\u2026 I won\u2019t stop you. But get your men to leave me alone from now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah shrugged, \u201cI may have to let you go now anyway\u2026 You sent one of my men to the hospital with that thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie tossed it aside, \u201cModified blue-ray\u2026 High-density lasers are invisible\u2026 So he never saw it coming. Just got blasted in the chest when he wouldn\u2019t back off. I showed him what it could do\u2026 Fired at the ceiling twice\u2026 But because he didn\u2019t see it fire, he didn\u2019t look up\u2026 I may have just got my first kill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah winced, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. Leave it at that\u2026 Now tell me what that thing attached to my mechanical arms is.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cO\u2019Connor. You are a dickhead. You got that?\u201d The man said as he slammed a piece of paper on the desk, the section chief looked up in surprise, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man turned to him, \u201cI\u2019m from Interrogation. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded and the man smiled, \u201cWell that man inside there is from Section Eight. You know what that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blood drained from O\u2019Connor\u2019s face, \u201cAnti-terrorism.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man shook his head, \u201cAnti-terrorism on the inside. He\u2019s internal affairs souped up a bit. He could fire you. Step lightly. Call in this, and see what they give you\u2026 It\u2019s part of his file. As for me\u2026 I\u2019m gone. Got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man didn\u2019t wait for an answer and stormed out, O\u2019Connor ran his eye over the document and winced, a clearance request of sorts\u2026 This didn\u2019t bode well for him detaining the man.</p>\n<p>He picked up the phone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cA perfectly understandable mistake\u2026 You needed an explanation though. I hope you have received one.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor nodded, \u201cI have\u2026 Your details may be in the hands of a few terrorist agencies\u2026 Including a few who would sell the information, or supply an assassin who had the information to anybody who could pay. Which means\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded, \u201cBack to ground zero. Let\u2019s go over what we know. Suzie took out a truckie who had a shotgun and would fire upon the Senator Davian.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cDavian is involved in promoting peace in the Middle East. He suggested the radical movement of causing a black out of sorts to disable weapons. This was thrown out immediately. But the threats began on that day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack frowned, \u201cWhat do we know about the truckie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a registered freight working for an Import/Export company connected to McIntyre Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Olsen\u2019s eyebrows rose, \u201cThere\u2019s something\u2026 But not much. What about the son?\u201d</p>\n<p>John shook his head, \u201cFalse identity. Son never existed. Tracked the records\u2026 All digital fakes\u2026 The hard copies are registered as \u2018damaged or missing\u2019 and cannot be recalled. So\u2026 Do we know who the truckie is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack scratched his chin, \u201cThe license checks out clean\u2026 But if our records have been tampered with, we can\u2019t rule out that it\u2019s false. So what do we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>John sighed, \u201cNothing\u2026 Nothing except that Susan Ashley Drakes has disappeared after an incredibly well set up assassination attempt took place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack\u2019s jaw dropped, \u201cHow could we have been so blind? She was the target. Davian was a red herring\u2026 What better way to catch a bodyguard? Make her run at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s compare the truck and where the bullet\u2019s hit, to where Suzie was. Get the tapes, I\u2019ll meet you at the impound.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded and turned away.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah turned around slowly and frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel like these actually have any strength in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie laughed, \u201cThen pick up the one tonne ball behind you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah sighed and turned around and went to brace himself as he picked it up, he frowned and Suzie laughed, \u201cToss it. Feel the strength.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned and tossed it back and forth between his hands, \u201cIt feels light as a feather\u2026 And natural. It just seems like I\u2019ve gotten stronger, not awkwardness\u2026 I barely realise that there\u2019s a metal frame pressing down on my arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded, \u201cGood\u2026 Now all we have to do is build the other two limbs, and then armour it. The armour can\u2019t be too heavy\u2026 It\u2019ll slow the reaction time a bit\u2026 How about light armour? Kevlar MrkII level?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cYour average cop wears that\u2026 It\u2019s barely even bullet proof\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie nodded, \u201cYeah\u2026 But this soldier will be faster and more accurate\u2026 More in your face. Harder to shoot, doesn\u2019t depend on his armour to save his ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded, \u201cMakes sense I suppose\u2026 But what about the EMP?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie looked over at the piece of hardware sitting on the desk, \u201cWe need to make it smaller\u2026 And more powerful. Ever thought of using a satellite transmission sequence to do it? Instead of simply a point of origin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cThe entire worldwide network would crash. No phone lines. No mobiles. No internet. Short wave radio would be the only thing that would still work\u2026 That\u2019s just plain nasty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie shrugged, \u201cIt was your idea to crash the network. You could isolate it to a region. Or regions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded slowly, \u201cCould it run a detection sequence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo see war? To see soldiers? Yeah\u2026 But it would wipe out training camps as well\u2026 Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. And it would wipe out every single country. I guess it would work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>O\u2019Connor frowned, \u201cHe\u2019s firing after she moves. Close enough to look real\u2026 But not quite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded, \u201cVery professional for a truckie wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cIndeed. Strange\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>John turned away to think as Jack bent over and examined the tape closer, as John looked at the truck, he touched the dints and then a smile grew over his face, \u201cThey weren\u2019t taking chances. These were made by rubber coated ball bearings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRubber bullets?\u201d Jack asked dubiously looking up, O\u2019Connor nodded, \u201cShell\u2019s make deeper holes\u2026 And they knock the paint off. They were trying to catch her\u2026 I think if she hadn\u2019t torn through the granite then she would have been lifted off the back by a helicopter. They didn\u2019t expect her to break through the granite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack bit his lip, \u201cSo where could they take her easily? And lose us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck the traffic for anomalies. Differences is traffic patterns\u2026 In the form of a track of transport that could transport her across the city. This was set up well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded and John frowned as his phone rang, he picked it up, and frowned, \u201cYou found him? Thankyou Styles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack raised an eyebrow as John hung up, \u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor frowned, \u201cDCS Styles found Samuel R. Anderson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe son? We couldn\u2019t find anything but forgery\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to meet with him.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cSo the false identity is real?\u201d O\u2019Connor asked, and Styles shrugged, \u201cHell if I know! This boy was definitely Senator Gregorio\u2019s bodyguard at one time\u2026 But by a different name. He lives near Parliament, by yet another name. He had eighteen passports at the house when we raided it. All legitimate as far as we can see\u2026 All different names. We can\u2019t prove any one of them is false, so what is that bugger\u2019s name?\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor frowned, \u201cGood question\u2026 How strong is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were like that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>John rolled his eyes, \u201cHe may have killed the man who is supposed to be his father.\u201d</p>\n<p>The DCS blinked, \u201cSigns of being an assassin for hire\u2026 Yet staying in range of Parliament for so long\u2026 You\u2019d have expected that he would have tried to pull a hit off\u2026 Unless of course he\u2019s a sleeper.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor nodded slowly, \u201cCan I talk to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cConsidering your connection\u2026 I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t. Yet, you can pull rank if you really want.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, \u201cGet the information out of him\u2026 Or I will.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jack smiled, \u201cPerfect\u2026 Sixteen unaccounted for anomalies\u2026 This should be easy enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then his phone rang and he picked it up, \u201cIf you want your boss to keep on living do what I say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack swallowed, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuzie found that out. She now can\u2019t come into the public for a while\u2026 Still want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack winced, \u201cShe was one of the best. What was so important that you needed to kidnap a bodyguard?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you can work that out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack sighed and ran a hand through his hair, and then he saw the man standing behind him in the computer screen\u2019s reflection. There was a gun pointing at his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I die if I hear the name? Can I get out of this without being kidnapped or shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a reason to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy boss told me what to do\u2026 And you freaking used me to kill your own men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anybody killed. I didn\u2019t order the hit on the cops. They weren\u2019t my people. However\u2026 I have some very, very nasty enemies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack sighed, \u201cCan I talk to her? Can we end this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get to speak three words. Choose them carefully. Everything will end in four days. She\u2019ll come back\u2026 We\u2019ll be all good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack nodded, and heard the phone be passed over and he sighed, feeling his gut tighten as he spoke, \u201cExecute Order Seventy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are out of your mind. I can\u2019t. Just drop it. Make O\u2019Connor drop it. Wait four days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack\u2019s jaw dropped, and then the phone hung up.</p>\n<p>He turned around and saw the man holstering his gun, and he made his decision.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>O\u2019Connor leaned forward as Styles walked into the room in front of him. John wondered what the man sitting in the chair on the other side of the one-way mirror was thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your name boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man rolled his eyes and spoke with a heavy accent, \u201cYou have my passport. What else do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles sat down in front of him, \u201cI want your name. Who the hell are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man shrugged, \u201cI do not care to answer this question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t think you really understand the gravity of the situation. An ASIO agent is missing, an attempt was made on the life of a senator and the man supposed to be your father turns up dead. Don\u2019t stuff around or I\u2019ll put your head through the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>John\u2019s eyebrows rose, Styles really was feeling the heat, or he really felt responsible\u2026 Either way, that was more emotion than he had expected.</p>\n<p>His phone vibrated and he frowned and pulled it out, answering absent minded, the voice on the other end got his attention though.</p>\n<p>\u201cA mistake. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d John hung up and turned to one of the other officers who were also watching, \u201cTell Styles that we\u2019ve caught an agent.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah\u2019s jaw dropped as he stepped out of the elevator, and Suzie laughed as she saw his face, he shook his head as he saw the complex structure that stretched to the roof and took up half the entire floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s enormous\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie shrugged, \u201cWell\u2026 With only low grade parts\u2026 It\u2019s the best I could do. You can\u2019t build a neuron network with standard computer parts\u2026 So you should be thankful I managed to achieve a quantum neuron network with standard computer parts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cHow much of it did you have to rewire yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie held out her hands, that were covered in burn marks, \u201cEvery freaking chip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded slowly, \u201cRight\u2026 So what can it do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie blinked, \u201cWhat do you want it to do? Nothing on any network knows how to connect to this thing\u2026 It can\u2019t even see it because there are no protocols in place for interconnectivity, so the security is bypassed immediately. Connect to anything and make it dance to your tune.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cOk\u2026 Find the cameras that I used to watch you when you were running from the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie frowned, \u201cOk\u2026 A bit of a challenge because I have no idea where they are right now\u2026 But it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabbed one of six keyboards that were plugged into the machine and hit a few keys, and a high pitch whine began, Josiah winced and covered his ears, \u201cSo I need to sound proof the room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie barely heard the shout and nodded, and then the whine vanished and she looked up at one of the eighteen monitors plugged into the QNN and frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou utter bas-\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>John walked into the interrogation room and closed the door softly, the man looked over at him and smiled. \u201cO\u2019Connor\u2026 Well\u2026 You\u2019ll be receiving a phone call in a minute. I suggest you do what it says.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor frowned, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Then his phone rang, he picked it up and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t this nice. Jack Olsen behind the mirror with Stacy McLaren, and you sitting in front of my agent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour agent is still in my possession. You want her to die?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. However\u2026 I would like to arrange a sort of deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad. You have exactly\u2026 Eighty hours from now. So, you can wait that time and get her back and have a chance to stop me later. Or you can never find her. Your choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>John ran a hand through his hair, \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll both be dead. Like Stacy is right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Connor spun around as he heard a thump, and then the one way mirror shattered and Stacy fell through with a bullet in her skull, he saw Jack sprinting up the hall behind somebody and firing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have listened O\u2019Connor. He can get in anywhere he likes, and do anything he wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>John turned around slowly, \u201cHe threatened one of my agents. He\u2019s killed another. Calculate the odds of you getting out of here alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>The agent nodded, \u201cNot exactly great\u2026 However\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>John dove to the side as the metal table was tossed into the air and spun to the side drawing his gun, and he saw the agent pointing a gun down at him already, and it wasn\u2019t one he recognised\u2026</p>\n<p>The agent smiled, \u201cCalculate your odds of getting out of here alive.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie glared at Josiah, \u201cWhy the heck have I been helping you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged, \u201cNo idea\u2026 But I\u2019m thankful for it\u2026 But now things have to change a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drew an object from his back pocket, and Suzie winced as she recognised the laser weapon she\u2019d made and Josiah nodded, \u201cShut up and back off. Or I will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie sneered, \u201cYou don\u2019t want an ASIO agent\u2019s blood on your hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah laughed, \u201cI have just ordered the death of Stacey McLaren. With the probable hit of Jack Olsen. You think I really care?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie moved, but immediately she fell forwards as agony tore through her left ankle, she looked down to see it half torn off and blood beginning to pour out and Josiah spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I\u2019ve gotten to know you a little bit. I\u2019d rather not kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She curled up as tears began falling down her face.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Jack ducked back behind the corner and winced as bullets began flying past at high velocity, the sound of the chain gun almost unbearable, he tried to control his breathing as the wall he was behind began to be chewed to pieces.</p>\n<p>He looked around, trying to work out his options, and then he saw somebody creeping slowly across the roof towards the entrance, and he recognised them immediately.</p>\n<p>He pointed his pistol and considered shooting, if he dropped the figure the agent would no doubt die\u2026 However the gunner might take notice of where he came from and redirect his fire\u2026</p>\n<p>To hell with it. An agent got killed beside him\u2026 Jack lifted his pistol and fired twice, taking out the agents hands, he dropped, and the bullets slammed into the body and blew it backwards.</p>\n<p>Jack nodded to himself, and then the gun stopped and a voice yelled out, \u201cStep into the open agents! Execute Order Seventy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack blinked and frowned, and then he realised that they were baiting him, he shrugged, if he could take down one with him, it was worth it.</p>\n<p>He stepped around the corner and fired twice, and then his head snapped backwards and he fell backwards.</p>\n<p>Two other thuds were heard at the same moment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>John O\u2019Connor stood up slowly and winced, touching his shoulder, no blood came off, yet he knew that the injury was serious\u2026 That much pain\u2026</p>\n<p>He gently turned his neck and looked at his shoulder, and saw that the skin had blackened and blistered\u2026</p>\n<p>He winced and stumbled over to the wall and hit the emergency klaxon, why hadn\u2019t anybody done that yet?</p>\n<p>He exited the room clumsily and then fell backwards against a wall coughing, he couldn\u2019t move\u2026 The klaxon cut off and he heard feet running, just as his vision began to fade he saw a group run in carrying a stretcher\u2026</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie looked up as a guard entered, Josiah looked at him, \u201cThe count?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLost the agent, and two others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded, \u201cWhat did we kill?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard frowned and spoke slowly, \u201cStacey McLaren, Jack Olsen and John O\u2019Connor is a probable, he got torched on his neck and shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah nodded slowly, \u201cWell\u2026 That makes things a lot easier.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>DCS Styles pushed passed the protesting nurse and stepped into the room, he felt himself suck in breath as he saw the bandages wrapped around O\u2019Connor, and saw his grey skin with ragged breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nurse coughed, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in here yet. He isn\u2019t ready for visitors. Not even with your authority.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cWhen he wakes up, tell him that I am going to take the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nurse frowned as Styles turned around and stormed out of the hospital, fire in his eyes.</p>\n<p>As he exited the building Styles pulled off his coat and tossed it into the rubbish bin and stepped into the police car.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet to the ASIO building.\u201d</p>\n<p>The driver frowned, \u201cWe have a restraining order on us from them\u2026 We can\u2019t go near it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles leaned forward, \u201cDid you just question a superior officer?\u201d</p>\n<p>The driver winced and began to pull away from the curb and Jason Styles prepared to break the law.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come in here chief superintendent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles frowned, \u201cDo you ever want to see Susan Drakes again? Then you\u2019ll get the best men you have and come with me. I can\u2019t go there because I don\u2019t have a warrant and probably can\u2019t get one. How about you forget for a moment that you work for the government and remember your fellow agents.\u201d</p>\n<p>The agent clenched his mouth for a moment then spoke quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t say that so openly next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The agent turned around and spoke, \u201cForm up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Several people appeared, and Styles blinked as he saw them donning Kevlar and loading shotguns.</p>\n<p>The agent turned back to him, \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles grinned, \u201cO\u2019Connor knows too bloody much.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah frowned, \u201cSo\u2026 Styles is on his way. Well, I guess we\u2019ll have to dissuade him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned to the guard and smiled, \u201cGet the suit. I\u2019ll take him out, while you take Suzie and toss her off the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard nodded, \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Styles frowned as the cars pulled up a block from the apartment building and he shook his head, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring in Josiah McIntyre\u2026 One of the smartest people alive, and he actually specialises in weaponry. He has to know we\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles stepped out of the car slowly and frowned looking at the other agents, \u201cHow far are you willing to go to get this girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>The agent he\u2019d spoken to earlier laughed, \u201cThis is personal now Styles. He attacked our own and killed one of us. Kidnapping pisses us off\u2026 Now he\u2019s killed one, and maybe two. He attacked O\u2019Connor. We\u2019ll go to hell and back to take this man out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Styles smiled, \u201cGood. Because that is pretty much what we\u2019re walking into.\u201d</p>\n<p>They pumped their shotguns and the agent grinned, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie frowned as she saw the guard stepping into the exoskeleton and realised something was wrong. Very wrong.</p>\n<p>She pulled herself into a stand slowly and bit her lip to stop from screaming and as the guard stepped into the elevator and began descending she half dragged herself over to the QNN and began typing, searching desperately to find a way out.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cStyles!\u201d</p>\n<p>He froze and turned and looked up as he saw on top of the apartment building a metal machine\u2026 And he realised that somebody was inside it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to hell!\u201d\nStyles growled and dove to the side as the pavement exploded where he had been standing.</p>\n<p>He looked at the agents, \u201cGet her out of there! I\u2019ll take this idiot down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled his pistol and ran into an alley, and smiled as he heard the machine hit the ground, then he winced as he heard shotgun blasts and screams as he realised that the man hadn\u2019t taken the bait.</p>\n<p>Styles stepped back to the entrance and fired twice, and the machine spun to him and raised a hand, and Styles swore and dove away as a rocket blasted towards him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Suzie blinked, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that easy\u2026 Can it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She tapped a few keys, and then heard a gun cock, \u201cTime to die little girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>She felt somebody grab her hair and she screamed as he dragged her, she spun and tried to punch him, he dropped her and slammed the barrel of his gun down on her injured ankle, she felt the air go out of her body and her vision swam for a moment with the agony.</p>\n<p>The guard sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t even try it. You don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suzie smiled and pulled herself to her feet, \u201cYou really have no idea do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He went to punch her and she caught the fist and swung around her mechanical arm.</p>\n<p>The guard never stood a chance, she heard his neck crack and he was thrown out of her grasp and she nodded and picked up the gun, turned back to the QNN and hit the enter key and it began to run a script.</p>\n<p>She turned and limped over to the elevator and hit the button to go down.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah spun around as another shotgun blast hit his armour, he sneered and activated the machine gun on the left arm, and the agent tried to dodge to the side, but he didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p>\n<p>Then he glimpsed the lobby of the apartment building and saw something disturbing. The elevator was on the move towards the ground, which meant Suzie was alive and well, and moving.</p>\n<p>He spun back and fired a rocket at the doors, it blew through the glass and slammed into the metal doors and the caved inwards in an explosion, and Josiah grinned he turned back around and saw two agents pointing shotguns at him.</p>\n<p>He sighed and raised both hands, and then he felt something slight, and leapt into the air, an agent fell backwards off him and he turned and fired a burst of the machine gun.</p>\n<p>He hit the ground and spun around slowly, looking at the remaining agents, \u201cDo you really think you have what it takes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Then something went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>On his Heads-Up-Display a timer appeared, the EMP\u2026</p>\n<p>He frowned and brought up the targeting system\u2026 And saw it had locked onto himself.</p>\n<p>He had thirty seconds until his suit was rendered useless.</p>\n<p>He activated the machine gun and spun around in a circle, gunning down the agents as soon as he could see them.</p>\n<p>He raised the rocket and blasted halfway up the elevator shaft.</p>\n<p>Josiah sighed and spoke quietly, \u201cYour too smart for your own good girl\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he saw her fall out of the hole he\u2019d created, tumbling and leaving a blood streak behind her.</p>\n<p>Josiah raised his machine gun and pointed it at her and yelled out, \u201cSuzie!\u201d</p>\n<p>She pulled herself slowly off the ground and looked at him, she smiled and raised a pistol, and pointed it at her own head.</p>\n<p>Josiah winced and bit his lip, he knew she\u2019d do it\u2026 To let him escape\u2026</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t want to.</p>\n<p>He wanted her to live.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Josiah roared in anger, and then Suzie tossed the gun aside, \u201cDo it yourself then!\u201d</p>\n<p>Josiah winced and clenched his fists for a moment and then activated the rocket on his other arm and aimed it at the ground and went to fire.</p>\n<p>Nothing happened.</p>\n<p>He tried to move and found he was frozen, then he realised his HUD had vanished\u2026 The EMP.</p>\n<p>Suzie limped over to the wall and picked up the phone and dialled a number.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Josiah McIntyre was never charged, but neither was he seen again.</p>\n<p>Susan Ashley Drakes was awarded for bravery and compensated for time spent in captivity; she was also given a gun license for use in her job as a bodyguard.</p>\n<p>John O\u2019Connor recovered, but never completely. He resigned soon after, however he kept in contact with most of his agents.</p>\n<p>Seventeen agents died in the attempt to free Miss Drakes \u2013 each was awarded a bravery medal and ASIO held a commemoration.</p>\n<p>Jason Styles never recovered from the injuries he sustained in the battle, and died three days after in hospital.</p>\n<p>The EMP however had a larger effect than had been seen. The entire USA experienced a four-minute power outage, as well as most of Europe.</p>\n<p>The culprit was never found, nor was one single entity blamed, merely a very large coincidence.</p>\n",
