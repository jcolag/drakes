Suzie's heart was going through the roof.

This was insane.

What the hell was she doing?

… This was about the dumbest thing she had ever done.

She was sitting quietly at a table, in an uncomfortable black dress…

 A dress!

… Whilst looking across the table at a kid who looked too big for his suit, wearing an incredibly sheepish expression.

Of course, he wasn't just a kid. His name was Ted, and he was kinda smart for someone her age, which wasn't something Suzie could usually say.

She'd flirted with Ted before Josiah had… Had… She winced.

Ted went into panic mode, "Is everything okay? Is it the restaurant? Don't you like seafood?"

Suzie shook her head, "Forget it. Just memories."

Crapsicles… Is this how crazy romance is? Is everything always this… Awkward?

She smiled sweetly, "Its perfect."

Heat flushed into his cheeks and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, "That's good."

Suzie sighed heavily and looked around the restaurant, "Exactly how can a high school student afford this?"

Ted smiled sheepishly, "I play a little bit of music now and then. You know, busking."

She glanced back at him, "Not just good at math? Music too?"

He shrugged, "Not that great. I can't write it. Just… Play."

Loosen up already!

Suzie smiled softly, "Still like to hear it sometime… What do you play?"

"A bit of… Uke, guitar… Piano… Sometimes I can be bothered to try violin, but usually that just ends with bloody fingers." Ted spoke shyly, and Suzie blinked, "What kind of music?"

He smiled softly, "Sort of… Jazz stuff."

Suzie grinned, thinking it through, "Experimental… Wait… You like discord don't you?"

He finally smiled openly, "Yeah. Drifting out to other places and so on… Its music without end… But I don't generally perform that kind of stuff… People find it weird."

She shook her head, "Not me. Its… Freedom."

The waiter arrived carrying their plates and lowered it slowly, "Madame, sir."

Suzie smiled from her doorstep at the nervous Ted, and kissed his cheek gently, giving him palpitations. "It was a good night. See you later?"

Ted swallowed, "Yeah, sure."

She grinned, "Buck up kid, you have my number, and I have yours."

Ted blinked, "Since when do you have my number?"

Suzie rolled her eyes, "I work for ASIO. I kinda like you. Put it together."

"That's illegal." He glared and then smiled, "And kinda sweet."

Suzie smiled and opened the door, "Sleep tight, Ted."

"You too," he said and turned and walked over to his bike.

She pushed open the door and walked in slowly, breathing in heavily.

"I hope it was a good night."

Pistol appeared in her hand, and Suzie glared at the man standing in her kitchen, "Do you have a death wish, Alistair?"

Her supervisor sighed heavily, "Authentication Code 9-Alpha-Seti."

Suzie sighed and holstered the weapon under her dress, "What the hell do you want?"

Alistair smiled softly, "We have a situation. You are being activated."

She rubbed her face, "Seriously? Right when a guy I actually like isn't a total asshole?"

Her supervisor didn't smile, "Relationships are unwise for someone in your position, Susan."

"My name is Suzie!" She exploded angrily, her fists tightening, and she seethed, "And I am about sick of you. I am sixteen, and you are more than a bit rude."

"I'm not your friend." Alistair growled, "I'm your handler. Get used to being handled."

She ground her teeth together, "Then what am I being handled towards?"

"Transfer. Canada. Authorisation Code 7169B83C." Alistair growled and Suzie breathed out in exasperation.

Transfer to Canadian Security Intelligence Service, explanation once on the soil in Ottawa.

In-bloody-convenient!

Suzie: [Sorry Ted! Work is evil. I have to go off the radar for a bit. I swear the date was good, and we'll have another once I'm back in the open.]

Ted: [Oh hell. I hope you stay safe out there.]

Suzie: [You know me.]

Ted: [Yeah. That's why I'm asking you to stay safe. Not do something stupid.]

Suzie: [Lol. Nice. I'll try.]

Ted: [Take care.]

Suzie: [I'll have another kiss for you when I get back.]
