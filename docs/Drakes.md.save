 
 
She was young, and was the youngest person to ever take up her 
current job. Yet that had a lot to do with the fact that she was a 
veritable genius. Her IQ ranked her as the smartest person alive, 
clocking in at 268, however she didn’t believe it, said experience 
meant more than any potential a Intelligence Quiz set her at. She had 
however invented a machine to help her, and that was what had gotten 
her employers attention. She had been involved in a car crash, a 
eight car pile up after a truck slid off the road because of ice, she 
was trapped for six hours, yet miraculously she escaped with only a 
broken arm – but it wouldn’t heal. So she created a exo-skeleton of 
sorts that wrapped around her arm, and linked it to her brain so she 
could operate it like a normal human, and it was even capable of 
giving her back full movement of her fingers, and it was very 
precise. This invention won her worldwide fame; she’d invented it at 
the age of eight. She was now seventeen, and was working as a 
bodyguard for Parliament. Her name was Suzie Drakes.
 
 She stepped in a closed the limousine door and instantly the senator 
spoke “Get me out of here… So sick of those idiots…” The driver 
pulled away from the curb slowly and Suzie turned and looked out the 
window, watching for potential threats, running algorithms through 
her head and creating a library of faces, matching up those that were 
already in her library with their purposes in the area. She couldn’t 
see any potential threat yet… Which probably meant she wasn’t looking 
hard enough, probably because she couldn’t care less right now. The 
senator was blabbing on to the driver about hard the job was, and how 
he was the only one who could see any sense so every motion he posed 
was being opposed. Then she saw something, and winced, she threw the 
door open and spoke, “Accelerate.” She spun onto the roof using her 
robotic right arm, and held on tight, enough that the metal dinted, 
as the driver did as she said, then she let go and leapt into the air 
as a truck passed beside her, she snagged the end of the trailer and 
pulled herself onto it, she walked up slowly towards the cab, just as 
a shotgun poked out of it, she threw herself to the side, almost 
rolling off just as the driver fired. Suzie stood up slowly and 
wished to hell that they’d let hr carry a real gun instead of the 
taser; she could have taken the driver out, even with a .357 from 
where she was, but not with a taser. She clenched her fists and 
frowned, considering her options, and then smiled as the maths proved 
useful. She sprinted up towards the cab, just out of reach from the 
shotgun and as she neared the cab she punched. The fist tore through 
the metal and hit something hard, she frowned as she pulled her hand 
back and cocked her head as she saw a slab of granite. They’d 
expected her to take on the truck… Which meant… She spun around and 
looked into the distance, just in time to see a car explode into the 
air – RPG. That got to her. She got to the driver, and introduced him 
to the road at 100km/h.
 
“It wasn’t your fault… You’re only seventeen for crying out loud! A 
decoy like that would have taken any agent in.” Suzie sighed, “I 
know… But that agent would have been able to help the senator avoid 
death by rocketed grenade because they would have shot the driver and 
then stopped the car to confirm the kill. They used the fact that 
everybody knows I can only use a taser. I can’t protect anyone right 
now. I’m just a show piece, and pretty terrible at that,” she raised 
her arm, “Because this isn’t exactly pretty now is it?” John 
O’Connor, the head of her division, sighed, “Not exactly. What about 
the incident three weeks ago with the gunman on the roof?” Suzie 
shrugged, “I was in the right place at the right time.” “What about 
the guy you pasted after he ran through the lobby doors?” Suzie 
laughed, “Anybody could have punched him out… And if they had you 
would have been able to talk to him in half an hour instead of three 
weeks.” O’Connor shook his head sadly, “Whatever… Go back to school 
then. For a year. You start your weapons training four days after 
your eighteenth. It’s an accelerated course for people who have a 
gift with numbers like you…” Suzie smiled, “You’ve learnt me well.” 
O’Connor grinned, “Well seeing as you fell asleep in you’re a-level 
physics classes and then aced the exam…” She grinned sheepishly, “It 
would have helped if he didn’t have a monotone.” O’Connor shrugged, 
“Go on, get out of here.” Suzie turned and tossed the taser onto the 
table, “Catch you later O’Connor.”
 
“No mum. I’m not doing it. That’s final.” “Come on honey, why not? 
You’re a hero! You could be an inspiration to those kids!” Suzie 
rolled her eyes, “I don’t want to be a celebrity. I want to get this 
over and done with. And what have I said about calling me honey?” Her 
mum sighed and put a hand on her hip, “Susan Ashley Drakes are you 
telling me what to do?” Suzie turned and walked away, and ignored the 
yelling behind her, why couldn’t she ever fit in? She was too young 
amongst the guards, and felt too bright amongst people her own age… 
She wasn’t going to a school where you didn’t have to study… It was 
one of the hardest in the country… Yet it had never been enough to 
challenge her after year seven… Everything had just fallen into place 
at the end of the year, and all her predictions had come true. Which 
teachers left, who went out with who, and how long it lasted. She had 
few friends, and thousands of enemies. But that was just another 
normal day. And her mum wanted her to let the Principal call a 
special assembly to welcome her back? Hell no.
 
She pushed the front doors open and walked into the corridor and all 
conversation stopped instantly. Suzie laughed and shook her head 
sadly and walked towards her locker as two boys began walking on a 
path to intercept her. She frowned and tracked the movements, they 
were on the grid iron team, and from their posture they were 
restraining themselves, attempting to match her speed, too bad. She 
wasn’t as restrained as she had been… Her training had taught her how 
to knock people senseless without leaving a mark on them. She reached 
the locker a couple steps ahead of them, their first mistake. She 
opened her locker and one put his hand on her right shoulder, second 
mistake. “Take your hand off me now or you won’t be going to school 
for a month.” She growled and he laughed, “What? You going to arrest 
me?” Third mistake. And his fourth was he didn’t remove his hand. She 
spun and grabbed it before he could see what was happening, her metal 
hand grabbed the base of his elbow and squeezed. He shouted as his 
elbow dislocated and she pushed him away and looked at the other, “If 
you want a fight you won’t find one here. You’ll find your ass gets 
kicked. Get lost.” He tried to punch her. She grabbed his wrist and 
used his momentum to fling his head into the platform that held her 
books up in the locker. It bent on the impact and the guy fell 
unconscious to the ground. Suzie turned back and raised an eyebrow, 
everybody turned away and began to speak hurriedly, and then came the 
familiar click of high heels on the floor. Perfect timing. Suzie 
pulled the jock out of her locker and dropped him as she got her 
books, the teacher rounded the corner, “Miss Drakes!” Suzie rolled 
her eyes, “I was restrained. I’m sure O’Connor explained everything 
earlier.” She walked away as the teacher moved her mouth in surprise, 
unable to find words.
 
“Therefore x is the equivalent of 3.4168974. Questions?” the student 
finished and Suzie raised her hand, the maths teacher shivered 
despite himself and nodded, “Go ahead Susan.” “Suzie.” She shot back 
and looked at Ted Jameson, “I think that you might want to check part 
6 again, because though it might not seem that a decimal point of 
.00000146 could affect the outcome, it changes it radically.” Ted 
nodded frowning, he turned back and flicked his eyes over the 
equation and smiled, “Thanks Suzie. It’s actually 4.17689 isn’t it?” 
“4.176892.” He laughed, “Right again…” Ted adjusted his calculations 
and sat down, a bemused expression on his face, and a few people 
starred at him, surprised, she did this every time usually. Once the 
bell went and they went to go to their next classes Ted walked passed 
Suzie, “Can I get the next three digits?” Suzie laughed, “Not yet 
boy. Try harder.” He laughed and walked away towards his class as 
Suzie went to hers in another direction, she considered him in her 
mind, bright, yet enough to know when he’s wrong, and yet still 
bright enough to put a few things together from practically nothing. 
Now she just needed to know how he behaved. She walked through the 
door to her class, and her instincts took over. She leapt forward as 
a metal bar slammed down behind her; she spun and kicked the 
assailant’s feet under from underneath him. She leapt to her feet and 
into the air as another baseball bat swung where her ankles had been, 
she hit the ground and turned and punched. Then she stopped and 
realised what had just happened, this was her social psychology 
class. She had been the experiment – and she had failed it by the 
looks of things. One student was seriously injured and another was 
picking himself off the ground. Suzie shot a look at her teacher, 
“That was just plain stupid. Would you have done that to a returning 
serviceman? You were told I was trained. You were told I did action. 
Don’t ever do anything like that again.” The teacher swallowed, “I 
thought a bodyguard’s prime directive was defensive, not offensive.” 
Suzie rolled her eyes, “Only while a client is within the threats 
proximity. If separated they are authorised to use lethal force if 
necessary to eliminate the threat.” The teacher nodded, “Stephen, can 
you take Jason to the nurse?” The student she’d knocked over nodded 
and picked up the other slowly and walked out of the room slowly and 
Suzie turned to the teacher, “I think you should forget this 
incident.” “Yet it is still a perfect example of neural networks.” 
Suzie sighed and found a seat, and pulled out her books, she sat back 
and refused to take notes.
 
Recess. Suzie grabbed a drink from her locker and headed out to her old haunt, and saw that as usual it was empty. She flipped easily into the tree and 
climbed up slowly to the top, and leant back to relax. Then she heard somebody below her, she clenched a fist and heard, “Easy girl.” She sat up in surprise 
as she recognised the voice, she almost fell out of the tree, barely grabbing a branch, he laughed as he climbed up opposite to her, “Hello Suzie.” She 
smiled and pulled herself back up, “You came here?” “After this morning I didn’t think I had a whole heap of choice.” John replied and Suzie winced, “Sorry 
about that… And about psych…” He nodded slowly, “Yeah… I kind of lost it when she told me what she’d tried… So she kind of knows what your capable of.” 
Suzie groaned, “Thanks a lot!” John shrugged, “Well… Davian survived. He’s asking for you.” “What? He barely recognised my presence for the last six months.” Suzie frowned, confused, and John nodded, “He said he felt crippled without a guard around who he could trust… And that reminded me of something. Did you recognise the driver?” Suzie ran the face through her mind and nodded, “I’ve seen him on three separate occasions near Parliament, and twice in the CBD. In the CBD he was fuelling a truck both times, however near Parliament he has only ridden a bike. A carbon fibre frame, most likely a GS17 series custom built Mõsler.” John laughed, “This is why I need you. Can you draw the face?” Suzie nodded and grabbed the proffered pad and sketched away, she handed it over after a moment and John’s eyebrows rose, “Quite a bit of detail there… Down to the acne scars… You saw that in an instant?” Suzie nodded again, “The human mind is capable of remembering more details than you could possibly believe.” John grinned, “Of course. I’ll run him against our database and see if we get any hits… What was his purpose near the Parliament?” Suzie frowned, “The reason I tracked was that he had a son living in the area. Samuel R. Anderson… I believe that he was once a bodyguard for Senator Gregorio. I thought he was clean.” John shrugged, “Everybody gets it wrong… And it could have been a once off thing, forced into it.” Suzie rolled her eyes, “If it had been he wouldn’t have shot at me unless there was somebody else in that truck. I doubt that there was.” John nodded and then Suzie’s eyes widened, “Your kidding me! I missed it…” John winced, “Yeah… He got away.” She bit her bottom lip and then spoke, “I broke his jaw. How could somebody in that state take out your guards?” John shook his head, “Average cops were taking him in. Both were shot with high density rounds.” Suzie frowned, “What do you want me to do?” “Finish school.” John said looking at her sternly, his face relaxed and he continued, “And keep in the loop. I’ll give you regular fortnightly check ups. I think I’ll put Jack on the missing truckie, what do you think?” Suzie shrugged, “He’s certainly capable of it… If he remembers his manners.” John laughed, “Right. I’ll remind him. See you later.” He dropped out of the tree and began walking away, and Suzie rolled her eyes as she saw girls going weak at the knees as he passed. Then the bell went and Suzie dropped to the ground and began walking towards her locker, as girls sprinted up to her, “What’s his number?” “Are you two going out?” “How old is he?” Suzie ignored them then opened her locker and grabbed her books, and turned and walked towards physics. She wondered whether Ted would work out the other three digits if she gave him a chance… She grinned at the thought. She opened the door and the teacher winced, “You really are back. Please don’t drool on the desk.” Suzie grinned, “I won’t… I think I might actually help out a bit this time around.” He tried to smile, but it came out more as a grimace. She took a seat and pulled out her books as the other students began arriving, and Ted immediately sat next to her, “Any chance at all?” Suzie laughed, “None with that attitude. Show a little more confidence, and a little more curiosity.” Ted laughed, “So I have to guess it do I?” The teacher coughed and Ted turned back to the front and he begun, “Today we are starting the chapter on trajectory. Please don’t snore Susan.” She gritted her teeth, “Suzie. And I’ll try not to.” The class laughed and he began, she tried to pay attention, but very quickly she blanked out. Then an opportunity arose and Suzie held up her hand as the fog lifted slowly after nobody could answer the question, and the teacher turned to her, “Go ahead Su...zie.” “The angle has an infinitesimal continuous decimal, so I won’t bore you all with exactness. But it is approximately 19.814 degrees and the force required is 27 newtons.” Ted’s head jerked up and he wrote a number down on his hand and Suzie sat down laughing, “That’s not it boy. Think a little more.” Ted frowned and looked at the figure, 0417 689 2 (814)-24.
